# GTA VI Landing Page Clone

A visually rich and animation-heavy recreation of the official GTA VI landing page. This project was built as a personal challenge to improve 
front-end development skills using **React**, **GSAP**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. It features smooth scroll animations, character sections,
immersive hero visuals, and video transitions.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React (with SWC)** – Component-based UI
- **Vite** – Fast development environment
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** – Advanced animations on scroll
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
